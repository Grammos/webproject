# webproject
College project. As a task I had to create a web site from scratch. I used html, css, php, sql etc.  

This project has this kind of folders: 

1) 148.902 Sea World; contains the photoshop files from which I build this site. 
It's wordpress theme. 

2) CSS folder, contains all the code CSS code because I had to make different folder not to mixed with HMTL.

3) Images folder.

And also this project has the php files only for About, Contact and Index. 

Also has the doc file, it's in Albanian language. It's the documentation format for the college.
